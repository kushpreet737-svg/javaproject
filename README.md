# Project Builder – Single File Java Program

A simple, console-based Java application that helps generate project documentation such as **README.md** and **statement.md** automatically.  
The program collects details like project title, problem statement, scope, modules, and requirements, then generates structured markdown files inside an `output/` folder.
